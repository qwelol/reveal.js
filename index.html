          Hello! Today i am gonna tell you about JSON web token.

        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>
          JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a
          compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information
          between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified
          and trusted because it is digitally signed.
        </p>
        <aside class="notes">
          Lets start with understanding what jwt is.
        </aside>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>What is it used for?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Authorization</li>
          <li>Information Exchange</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          The most common scenario for using JWT is Authorization. And also JSON
          Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information
          between parties.
        </aside>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Header</li>
          <li>Payload</li>
          <li>Signature</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          The JWT consist of 3 parts. They are header, payload, signature.
          Header and payload are a common JSON objects which are encoded using base64url algorithm.
          Encoded parts concatenate to each other and based on them, a signature is calculated, which also becomes part
          of the token

        <h3>what does jwt looks like?</h3>
        <img src="./examples/assets/jwt-look.png" alt="" />
        <aside class="notes">
          This is how JWT looks like. Different colored text indicates parts of token.
          Red text represents header, pink part is payload and blue text is signature.
          When we just look at this picture, we dont realize whats going on. Now lets figure out what all these parts
          are for.
        </aside>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>header</h3>
        <p style="text-align: left">Encrypted:</p>
        <code>
            <pre>
					eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9
				</pre
            >
          </code>
        <p style="text-align: left">Decrypted:</p>
        <code>
            <pre>
					{
						"alg": "HS256",
						"typ": "JWT"
					}
				</pre
            >
          </code>
        <aside class="notes">
          The header typically consists of two parts: the signing algorithm being
          used and the type of the token (for compatibility), which is always JWT
        </aside>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Payload</h3>
        <p style="text-align: left">Encrypted:</p>
        <code>
            <pre>
				eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ
			</pre
            >
          </code>
        <p style="text-align: left">Decrypted:</p>
        <code>
            <pre>
				{
					"sub": "1234567890",
					"name": "John Doe",
					"iat": 1516239022
				}
				  </pre
            >
          </code>
        <aside class="notes">
          The payload contains any information that usually helps application to identify user one way or another.
          In our case, payload contains the following fields: sub is a user identificator, name is a username and iat is
          a time when token was generated in Unix time format.
        </aside>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Signature</h3>
        <p style="text-align: left">Encrypted:</p>
        <code>
            <pre>
				SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
			  </pre
            >
          </code>
        <p style="text-align: left">Creation (pseudocode):</p>
        <code>
            <pre>
				HMACSHA256(
					base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
					base64UrlEncode(payload),
					secret)
			</pre
            >
          </code>
        <aside class="notes">
          The signature is used to verify the message wasn't changed along the
          way, and, in the case of tokens signed with a private key, it can
          also verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is.
          On this slide we can see the pseudocode of signature creation method.
          Since the header indicated the HS256 encryption method, this algorithm is used to generate the signature.
          But we also can use many different algorithms for this task.

        <h2>advantages</h2>
        <ul class="r-stretch">
          <li>There is no need to store information about all issued tokens</li>
          <li> An application may not be in charge of issuing tokens </li>
          <li> JWT helps to organize microservice architecture</li>
          <li> Data transmission in payload helps to improve application performance</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          Advantages of JWT based on fact that it validates itself using own signature. Therefore the application does
          not need to store information about all issued tokens. That means that tokens issuing may be the other
          application's task and the user can get access to resources which trust this authentication service with his
          own token.
          Such principle of applications building is called a microservice architecture.

        <h2>limitations</h2>
        <ul class="r-stretch">
          <li>JWT does not implement payload encryption</li>
          <li>
            JWT stolen by an attacker allows him to impersonate a user for an unlimited time
          </li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          JWT also has some limitations. As said before, payload is encrypted using the base64 algorithm. It means that
          data transferred in payload are not secured.
          Also if our token will be stolen, the application will accept it as usual.
        </aside>

        <h2>How to avoid this?</h2>
        <p>Don't transfer private data in payload</p>

        <h2>How to avoid this?</h2>
        <p>Use JWT with limited lifetime</p>
        <aside class="notes">
          To prevent an attacker from using the stolen token, use a JWT with a limited lifetime.
          Then jwt issue process will become more complicated. But this topic requires deeper study. And thats all for
          now.
